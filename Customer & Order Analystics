In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

How many orders were placed in January?

SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
Where Product= 'iPhone' 
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.BIT_

SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers inner join BIT_DB.FebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';


Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

Select distinct product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price asc
limit 5;

What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

Select product, sum (quantity) * price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
Group By product
ORDER BY revenue asc;

Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

Select product, 
sum (quantity), 
sum (quantity) *price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
Where location = "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
GROUP BY product;

How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

Select Count(distinct customers.acctnum),
avg(quantity*price)
From BIT_DB.FebSales left Join BIT_DB.customers
On FebSales.orderid = customers.order_id
Where FebSales.Quantity> 2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
